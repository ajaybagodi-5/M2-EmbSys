# Problem Statement
Solar Tracking System for Automated Irrigation 

# Abstract
As the non-renewable energy resources are decreasing, use of renewable resources for producing electricity is increasing. Solar panels are becoming more popular day by day. Solar 
panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.

The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a 
maximum extent. This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun. 
The stored energy can be utilized when required or can be used as a direct alternative to the grid supply. Utilization of the energy stored in batteries is use for irrigation for the forms, 
automatic light and in the fields where the application can be applied. 

Energy cost and decreasing supplies of fossil fuels, emphasis on protecting the environment and creating sustainable forms of power have become vital, high priority projects for modern 
society. Since, as solar energy which is also considered a renewable form of energy can be used to offset some of the power coming from the main grid that is generated by let us say 
nonrenewable sources of energy.

# Requirements
# High Level Requirements

*  It should be able to solve common human(health) problems.
* monitoring heartbeat, blood pressure, and body temperature are features that make the device even more useful. 
* A suitable battery is one that lasts long, is rechargeable, and has a low risk of overheating or catching on fire. 

# Low Level Requirements

* Smartwatches monitor steps and track speed, numbers of kilometers run, and more,
* smart watches should have clock and connectivity.
* Lightweight, and easy to wear.


# Components

# Microcontroller

An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and that controls some or all of the functions of an electronic device (such as a home appliance) or system

# Voltage Regulator

 Voltage regulator ensure to have a constant output voltage with a variable input supply. Whenever there is a need to have a steady and reliable output voltage then voltage regulators are the most preferred circuits.
 
 # Acclerometer
 
 An accelerometer is an electromechanical device that is used to measure acceleration forces. Such forces may be static like the force of gravity or, they may be dynamic as in the case of mobile devices.
 
 # Memory Chip
 
 Which helps to store the data.
 
 # LCD(EPD/TFT)
 
 A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.
 
 # Bluetooth
 
 Bluetooth allows devices close to each other to communicate over the air. Bluetooth antennas typically have a rage of either 10 or 100 meters. Most mobile phones and expensive computers have Bluetooth build in. Bluetooth antenna can also be added to a computer through a USB port.
 
 # Sensors
 
 * Heart Beat Measurement Sensor
 * Steps Measurement Sensor
 * Humidity Sensor
 * Temperature Sensor
 * Blood Pressure Monitoring Sensor

# Push Button

which used to power on the device

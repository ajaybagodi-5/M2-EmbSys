# Requirements

# High Level Requirements

* The RFID tags are attached to each vehicles.
* One RFID reader is fixed at one side of the road near junction.
* If any vehicle crosses the signal then active RFID tags are detected by RFID readers and that vehicles information will be sent to nearest control room through GSM modem.
* Basic Power supplies should be used.

# Low Level Requirements

* Frequency for RFID uses 433Mhz for short range devices.
*  Electromechanical or electronic components are used to regulate one or more AC or Dc voltages.



# components

# Power supply divided in to 4 parts

which supplies electric power to electrical load
1.Transformer
2.Rectifier
3.Filter
4.Regulator

# Microcontroller

A microcontroller is a small and low-cost microcomputer, which is designed to perform the specific tasks of embedded systems.

# RFID

RFID stands for radio frequency idetification,used for the purpose of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects.

# GSM

GSM is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information and demodulates the signal to decode the transmitted information.
